(see :ref:`selected_entity`).
This information has some fields that are general for all the entity kinds, and some others that depends on
the specific entity kind:

* **General fields**

    * **name**: internal name of the entity
    * **id**: internal unique id for each entity

* **Process**

    * **pid**: Process Id in its host

* **Topic**

    * **type_name**: name of the data type of the topic

* **Participant**

    * **GUID**: DDS GUID
    * **QoS**: DDS QoS information

* **DataWriter**

    * **GUID**: DDS GUID
    * **QoS**: DDS QoS information

* **DataReader**

    * **GUID**: DDS GUID
    * **QoS**: DDS QoS information

Statistics Panel
================
In this panel it is displayed a summary of some data types of the entity that is currently **selected**
(see :ref:`selected_entity`).
Regarding the selected entity, the data will be fulfilled collecting all the data of all the entities related to the
this one.
The data is calculated by accumulating the data of this entity (using a specific `StatisticKind` in
each case) in one bin from the first to the last data available.
In case there is no selected entity, the information displayed is the group of all the entities that exist in the
application.
The data displayed is the following:
