The central window allows multiple tabs for different views.
It is also displayed a collapsed menu with the possible problems that have been detected on the DDS entities.
It will display the data charts, so-called *Chartbox*, that the user has configured.
It will display a domain graph where the physical, logical and DDS entities from a domain are represented,
focusing on the connection between endpoints through the topics, and the entities physical inheritance.

.. figure:: /rst/figures/screenshots/main_panel.png
    :align: center

For further information about how to create a chart refer to the section :ref:`chart_panel`.

.. _chartbox_layout:

Chartbox
--------
These windows in the main panel store some *series* or *data configurations* to show a specific data type for
one or several entities in a specified time interval and with different accumulative operations on the data.

To create a new *Chartbox* go to *Chart View* in the Main Panel default tab, and click on *Create new chart* button.
This button will create a new *Chartbox* where new series could be added, removed or modified.

These Chartbox could be moved along the *Chart View* tab.

:ref:`dynamic_series` for dynamic data.

.. _domain_graph:

Domain View
-----------
This view in the main panel shows the connections between DataWriters and DataReaders that belong to the same
DDS Domain.
They are represented encapsulated inside their physical entities (see :ref:`entities` relationship), and with a
connection to the topic they are published and subscribed, respectively.

.. figure:: /rst/figures/screenshots/domain_graph.png
    :align: center

By clicking on any entity, its detailed information is displayed in the :ref:`info_panel`.
Right click allows changing the alias of the entity, filter the problems to display only the selected entity's problems
and, in the case of topics, filtering the domain graph by topic so that only the entities related to the selected topic
are displayed.

.. _problem_summary:

Problem summary
---------------

This section that can be expanded and collapsed displays all the collected problems per entity.
Those problems are related to DataReader samples lost, incompatible QoS between endpoints, or DataWriter deadline missed
counter, for instance.

The entities that have reported a problem would display a warning or an error icon close to the entity name, based on
the severity of the problem.
The entity representation in the domain graph may also display that icon.
