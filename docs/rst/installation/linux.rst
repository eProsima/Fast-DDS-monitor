Fast DDS Monitor on Linux
#########################

This section provides instructions on how to install the *Fast DDS Monitor* application.
This is available on the `eProsima <https://www.eprosima.com/>`_ website in the
`Downloads <https://www.eprosima.com/index.php/downloads-all>`_ section.

There are two mechanisms for running the monitor application.

- Through the *Fast DDS Monitor* installer.
- Using the *AppImage* format, which is a portable format of the application software.

*Fast DDS Monitor* installer
============================

The first option is to install the *Fast DDS monitor* application together with all its dependencies.
To do so, first run the ``eProsima_Fast-DDS-Monitor-<FastDDS-Version>-Linux.run`` executable,
(you might need to make the file executable by running
``chmod +x eProsima_Fast-DDS-Monitor-<FastDDS-Version>-Linux.run`` first)
and follow the instructions it provides to install the program in a directory on the system.
