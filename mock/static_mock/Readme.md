# Fast-DDS-Statistics-Backend Static Mock

Mock that simulates the input data from an active FastDDS Statistics Backend.

## Entities

The entities that the mock simulates are always the same (there are no new ones).
There is one entity of each kind, and their internal info and data is randomly generated.
